# backend-mern-express-router1

Start with our MERN template: https://github.com/cs-fullstack-master/backend-mern-template

1) Make a new route with the path “/api” and put all the current endpoints in there.
2) Change the default route of “/” to only send responses of “You have to call /api for this to work!”

Extra work: Figure out how to easily make all methods return “You have to call /api for this to work!”
